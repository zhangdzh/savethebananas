  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

  <p>Imagine. A BANANA. Think of the banana as you know it. The chief type of exported bananas. That may not be around in a few decades. Due to the huge amount of genetic engineering that has taken place, all bananas nowadays are more or less the same. This, unfortunately, prevents natural selection, as there are very few attributes present in only a few bananas.If there were to be a bacterium the bananas aren’t resistant to, it could very well wipe out the entire species. Take action. Reach out to your Congressmen. SAVE. THE. BANANAS. </p>

  <h2>HISTORY</h2>
  <p>A few decades ago, the export banana was the Gros Michel. However, in 1965, a fungal disease stemming from Central America caused the bananas to go commercially extinct. Seeing as the bananas were all genetically structured in the same way, a substantial number were unable to survive to keep Gros Michel as the primary export banana. Since then, the Canvendish cultivar, an inferior banana, as served as the chief export banana. Yet, even with the example set in 1965, banana planters still have yet to learn. Genetic diversity is key, and in the banana industry, there is next to none. Therefore, if there were to be another disease to affect even one banana, it could wipe out the Cavendish cultivar, just like the Gros Michel.</p>

  <h2>INEVITABLE FUTURE</h2>
  <p>Bananas die once one banana is infected. India and Ecuador’s economies will suffer drastically, as they are the largest banana producer and exporter (respectively). Due to globalism, this would cause the world economy to suffer as a whole. The decline of bananas will affect every part of the globe. Not to mention, what’s going to sustain the vegans? How are they going to survive? They already can’t eat half the menu. Start caring. About yourself. About vegans. About the world.</p>
